This blog was created in order to express my passion in sports and data analysis illustrating interesting aspects of the game from a different prospective. As a two-time Daktronics-NAIA Menâ€™s Soccer Scholar-Athlete and team co-captain, I bring a strong personal work ethic to all my activities. My goal is to bring both a game knowledge and experience to my analysis and conclusions.
